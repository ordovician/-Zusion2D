# Zusion2D

An attempt to try out the Zig programming language by trying to port parts of an old 2D game engine I never finnished writing, called Lusion2D.

I am doing the coding using [TextMate 2][mate2] with the [Zig language bundle][zigbundle], which also works for [Sublime Text][subl]. This gives an easy way to run Zig run, build etc.

## Random Remarks
I really like how tests are embedded in the regular source code files. Makes it really easy to trigger tests while working on code in the same file.

When coding it is a bit like going down memory lane, remembering what C coding was like. Makes it easier to get up to speed.

But there is also definitely a Go like feel in how convenient stuff works.
